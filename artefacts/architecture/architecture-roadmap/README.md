# Target State Architecture Roadmap



The Architecture Roadmap lists individual work packages that will realize the Target Architecture and lays them out on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture. The Architecture Roadmap highlights individual work packages’ business value at each stage. Transition Architectures necessary to effectively realize the Target Architecture are identified as intermediate steps. The Architecture Roadmap is incrementally developed throughout Phases E and F, and informed by readily identifiable roadmap components from Phase B, C, and D within the ADM.


The following depicts the Client current roadmap from baseline 
enterprise architecture to the final target state architecture.

The TOGAF® Content Framework (see Architecture Deliverables) identifies deliverables that are produced as outputs from executing the Architecture Development Method (ADM) cycle and potentially consumed as inputs at other points in the ADM.
This deliverable is produced, updated, and consumed by the ADM Phases:

| **DELIVERABLE** | *Output from...* | *Output to...* |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | 
| Architecture Roadmap | B,C,D,E,F | B,C,D,E,F |
