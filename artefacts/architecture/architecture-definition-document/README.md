# Architecture Definition Document

# Executive Summary 

This document details the baseline architectures, business proposition, target architecture vision, migration requirements, and provides a gap analysis between the two.

# Purpose

The Architecture Definition document is the deliverable container for the core architectural artifacts created during this project and spans all architecture domains (business, data, application, and technology). It and also examines all relevant states of the architecture (baseline, interim state(s), and target).

The Architecture Definition document is a companion to the Architecture Requirements Specification (yet to be prepared for this project), with a complementary objective:
* The Architecture Definition document provides a qualitative view of the solution and aims to communicate the intent of the architects.
* The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a quantitative view of the solution, stating measurable criteria that must be met during the implementation of the architecture.

_It is suggested that this document reference the various deliverables in the container. For instance, the architecture principles will be documented in an Architecture Principles document and that document referenced here. It may be that this container is implemented using a wiki or as an intranet rather than a text-based document. Even better would be to use a licensed TOGAF tool that captures this output._

_This template shows typical contents of an Architecture Definition document and can be adapted to align with any TOGAF adaptation being implemented._

# Target Audience
This deliverable is intended to be consumed by all individuals involved in the project. It defines a vision and high-level architecture that address the business drivers of the project.
This document, therefore, should act as an input into further stages of elaboration, with new insights back-propagated as revisions to this document.

# Scope and Project Goals

This section's purpose is to outline the architecture for key domains and clarify the scope of this document.

## Architecture in Scope

The following parts of the enterprise architecture are to be considered 
in the scope of this document and the architectural project:

* Business Architecture
* Data and Information Architecture
* Security Architecture
* Technology Architecture
* Systems Architecture pertaining to new systems and integration with partners.
  * Including: Change Management and Runtime Infrastructure

#### Architectural Focal Points of This Document

This document will primarily attempt to maintain a focus on architectural concerns 
relating to business, data, security, technology, and systems for
near and long-term integration.

#### Constraints

#### Domain Boundaries

The architectural direction is confined to solutions, processes, and systems 
affecting the following domain model, which was elicited from subject matter experts involved in the project.

# GAP Matrix

The table below compares the known capabilities of the baseline platform and contrasts this with the intended target state 
architecture.

## Identified Gaps

### Title

Details

# Risks

See the [risk registrar](../risks/) for a breakdown of current known risks.

The primary concern 

These risks need to be addressed using a proof of concept. See below.
 
# Tailored Architecture

The project will follow the ADM specified in the [Summary Statement of Architecture Work](../architecture-sow/).

# Architecture Principles
The architecture should be built on the principles outlined [Architecture Principles Document](../architecture-principles/) 

Note that these principles also provide leniency for proofs of concepts and learning-related implementations.

# Roadmap

The [Architecture Roadmap](../architecture-roadmap/) demonstrates the 
near and long-term plan for this architectural effort.
